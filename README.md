Hey everyone, just a quick heads-up â€” **I'm not the best script developer** out there. I'm still learning, and I know my scripts are **missing a lot of features** or aren't as polished as they could be. I'm doing my best to improve, and I really appreciate your patience and feedback! **@wearebased on discord**
